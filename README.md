## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project üìäüîç

### Overview ‚ÑπÔ∏è
This repository contains the code and documentation for an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project conducted on the Aspiring Mind Employment Outcome 2015 (AMEO) dataset. The project aimed to analyze the employment outcomes and academic performance of engineering graduates, with a focus on demographic features, academic metrics, job-related variables, personality traits, and the salary target variable.

### Objective üéØ
The primary objective of this EDA project is to analyze the employment outcomes and academic performance of engineering graduates using the AMEO dataset. Specifically, we aim to:

  Gain insights into the demographic characteristics, academic metrics, and personality traits of engineering graduates.  
  Explore the relationships between academic performance, job-related variables, and salary outcomes.  
  Identify patterns and trends in the data that could inform decision-making for academia, industry, and policy-making.
